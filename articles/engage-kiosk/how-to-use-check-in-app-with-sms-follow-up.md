####  **ðŸ”‘Very important:** Please put your Google Maps link to your business
here, that's where your customers will be sent to to write review. Click
[here](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/23629657318547-How-to-
get-Google-Review-link) to learn more on Google review link.

Note that the {{shop.name}} used in SMS message is the Company Name in your
[company profile](https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/company-profile)

If you have multiple locations, you can reach out to us to learn about how to
set up Functional Locations so each location will have their own name.

Due to SMS regulation, very limited changes, and customization can be done to
the SMS message. The message content has to remain pretty much constant, the
only thing that can be changed is the company name.

By default, the customer will receive an SMS message **4 hours** after check-
in asking about their experience and write a review for you on Google.

## **That's all! It's just that simple!**

We hope Check-in all will help you to enhance your customer experience and
grow your business faster!
