### Option 1: Selecting a Direct URL

If you are using a **direct URL** , you will need to input a URL and then
click **Add**.

Once you have added your direct URL, you will be redirected back to your
template or design.

For a direct URL, here are the link options to choose from:

  * **Update Link:** Allows you to update your link to another direct URL or another asset

  * **Duration (seconds):** Sets the maximum duration of how long your asset will display on the screen before returning to the main page.
  * **Preload:** Defaults to checked. Preload the URL or asset in the background to allow for instant display. This improves user experience. However, if you have animation or dynamic content on your page, you may want to disable this.
  * **Close Icon:** Allows you to customize where you would like the Close icon to display on your asset. 
    * None
    * Top Left
    * Top Right
    * Bottom Left
    * Bottom Right

    * **Icon Position:** Fine-tune icon placement within the bar for maximum visibility and accessibility.

      * Options: None, top left, top center, top right, bottom left, bottom center, bottom right.

    * **Icon Style:** Harmonize your kiosk's look by selecting an icon design that fits your aesthetic.

      * Options: Default, Outline, Solid, or Thin, ensuring alignment with the Close icon's font style.

    * **Icon Color:** Enhance your brand's identity by customizing icon colors to match your theme.

    * **Icon Size:** Adjust icon sizing for user-friendly recognition and interaction.

  * **Show Navigation Bar:** Enable to allow for back and forward navigation for enhanced user navigation. Enabling this also introduces additional options: 
    * **Navigation Bar Background Color:** Personalize the navigation bar's background color to complement your design.

    * **Navigation Bar Opacity:** Modify the navigation bar's opacity for either a subtle or pronounced appearance.

If you want to set these options as your default for future use, see our "[How

article.

### Option 2: Selecting an Asset

If you are using an **asset** , you can either choose an asset from within
your library, upload a file, create a new app, or choose a Feeds.

Once you select your asset to be linked, you will be redirected back to your
template or design.

For **assets** , you will have all the **same link options**as explained in
direct URL section, with the addition of **Scale**.

  * **Scale:** Defaults to Fit. This option will resize your asset per the selected preference 
    * None
    * Fit
