#### **What can OptiSigns AI Camera detect?**

OptiSigns AI Camera detects:

  * Persons
  * Faces
  * Gender: Male, Female
  * Age: Child, Young Adult, Adult, Senior Adult (future feature)

* * *

#### **What data does OptiSigns collect? Is it GDPR and SOCII Compliant?**

OptiSigns use facial detection (not recognition) technology, and only collects
the following anonymous data:

  * Person detected
  * Face detected
  * Person's gender
  * Person's age group

This data is:

  * Anonymous and not personal identifiable
  * Processed on the fly on the local device

OptiSigns does not store images or facial identification information on our
servers, or locally on the device through the OptiSigns Digital Signage app.
The ONLY stored data points are the four points above, which can be accessed
through the **AI Analytics** tab in the OptiSigns web portal.

Therefore, **OptiSigns is GDPR and SOCII compliant.**

However, customers can store images and facial ID through the use of third
party software via their webcam. This is done completely outside of OptiSigns,
and would require compliance with local laws and regulations.

#### **How accurate is the detection?**

OptiSigns AI is optimized for real-time detection, not accuracy.

In general, expect **80+%** accuracy in detection.
