# How to manually install & activate OptiSigns AI Add-on on Linux or Raspberry Pi

OptiSigns AI Add-on is a background service running on your Linux, Raspberry
Pi device to use a Camera to detect & count people passing by.

If you have not tried to automatically activate this feature, please try it
first by following [this guide](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-
us/articles/27690296225555).

The add-on is a ~200MB app, so it will take several minutes to download and
activate on your device, so please be patient after auto-activation before you
try manual activation.

If auto-activation fails, then you can follow these steps to manually install
& activate AI detection add-on on your Linux or Raspberry Pi devices.

**Before you start, please ensure that you have:**

  * Your device has OptiSigns Digital Signage player version 4.2.10 or newer installed. You can download the latest version [here](https://www.optisigns.com/download).
  * There's a network connection to your device
  * You have enough authorization, and privileges to install apps, and background services on your device
  * optisigns-ai-detection runs on any Raspberry Pi OS, or any major Linux distro such as Ubuntu.

## **How to manually install optisigns-ai-detection**

Make sure you have a camera installed on your system.  
Open Terminal.

On Raspberry Pi run:

    
    
    curl -s https://links.optisigns.com/ai-add-on-rpi-install -L | sh

On Linux run:

    
    
    curl -s https://links.optisigns.com/ai-add-on-linux-install -L | sh

This will download a script and run the installation.

After you see "Starting OptiSigns AI Detection Service ..." you are done!
