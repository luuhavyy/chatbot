# How to use Live TV with Ads App

**NOTE**  
---  
This feature is available to subscribers with an **Engage plan** or above.  
  
The Live TV with Ads app allows you to pop in ads of your choice on top of on
going live TV.

This can help turning your existing Sports Bars, Waiting Room TVs, etc. into
revenue generating devices.

Localized, relevant ads like below is proven to increase sales.

#### **Before we get started, a few points on how to best use these type of
pop in ads:**

  * Make your ads visible, but obstructive. While you can place the ads anywhere, it's better to place in the corners (bottom right, top left, etc.) instead of middle of the screen.
  * Make the ads jiggle, this will capture much more attention (see how below).
  * Make time based, localize ads (i.e. $2 off beers in next 30min) which will create a sense of urgency and proven to have better conversion.
  * Place it on TV program that people actively watching (Sport is great example).

  * Ad Size: How large the ads should be on your screen
  * Scale Ad: If the ad is not fit in your ad frame. i.e. your ad frame ratio is 16:9 and your ad is 9:9, what should the player do: [Nothing, Fit, Zoom or Stretch](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026610194)?.
  * Play for: How long the Ad should be played on the screen (This setting determine how long the ads will be played, not the Playlist duration)
