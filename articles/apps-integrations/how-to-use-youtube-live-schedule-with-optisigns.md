# How to use YouTube Live Schedule with OptiSigns

A real world scenario would be:

A church has scheduled a video to go live on Sunday morning at 9 o'clock
through YouTube Live. If the main hall is filled, the church has overflow
rooms with televisions, screens for signage, and presentations. You can use
the OptiSigns YouTube Live schedule feature to schedule a live session to
broadcast in the overflow rooms every Sunday 9AM automatically.

Putting YouTube Live Schedule on your digital signs screens is easy with
OptiSigns.  
You just need to copy the YouTube channel link and paste in the YouTube Live
Schedule app and select the schedule.  
**Note: To use the app, Youtube Channel URL is required. The format is like
below**

**https://www.youtube.com/channel/Your-Channel-Id  
To get your channel Id, go to the about page of your channel, click on share
channel and copy channel Id.**

## **Optional, Schedule your event to go on your signs at specific time.**

Next, you can put the YouTube Live Schedule in your Schedule.

Say you want your 9AM-11AM event to be schedule every Sunday.

For more information about using Schedule, please refer to [Schedule
Guide](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016981853).

NOTE: If your schedules ends earlier than 11AM, YouTube Live Schedule will
play the next video on your Channel.

## **Tips & Notes:**

You should set your event in YouTube to live a few minutes before the actual
schedule time in OptiSigns, as YouTube take a few mins to set the event live.

If you set your event to be live publicly (so people can view it without
logging on to YouTube), it may take up to 10min from the time you set the
event to Live till the time it's actually live on YouTube (likely due to
YouTube review process).

## **That's all! Congratulation!**

You have added a YouTube Live Schedule.

You can assign the newly created YouTube Live Schedule asset to your screen by
going to Screens, click Edit screens and assign the wall to screens that you
want.

You can put the YouTube Live Schedule to a Playlist, Schedule too.
