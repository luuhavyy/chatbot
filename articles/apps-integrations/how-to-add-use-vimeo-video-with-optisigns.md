# How to add & use Vimeo video with OptiSigns

We support Vimeo out of the box.

You just need to log on, add Vimeo App:

Then go to Vimeo, find the video you like to copy the link

Then Paste the link to OptiSigns' Vimeo app.  
You don't have to enter the video name, the app will automatically get the
official name of the video from Vimeo.

You then can use this Vimeo video on your playlist or assign directly to
screen if you'd like.

**Note** : If you want to set your Vimeo as not public, you can set your Viemo
as "**Hide from Vimeo".** Then you can add "[social-
player.optisigns.com](http://social-player.optisigns.com/)" in the Specific
domains of Embed.

If you have any additional questions, concerns or any feedback about
OptiSigns, feel free to reach out to our support team at
