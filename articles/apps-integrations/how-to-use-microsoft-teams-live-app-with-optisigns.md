# How to use Microsoft Teams Live app with OptiSigns

You can broadcast a Microsoft Teams Live on your digital signs with OptiSigns.

Sign in to [Office 365](https://www.office.com/) using your credentials.

Go to Teams:

Click on Calendar:

Under New meeting, select Live event (_It is better to download Microsoft
Teams Desktop app for running the live event):_

Give the event a name and location, then click Next:

__

Make sure to set it as public, no login is required:

Click Schedule, then 'Get attendee link' to copy attendee URL:

Log in to OptiSigns:  
Click [Files/Assets -> Apps](https://app.optisigns.com/app/assetManagement) ->
and select Microsoft Teams Live:

Give your MS Teams Live app a name and paste the copied attendee URL in there:

For not Public Live event (Sign-in required):

You can set Username and Password in Advanced section:

**Important Note:** If you are utilizing the OptiSigns Android Stick kindly
ensure that the Live Meeting is set to **public**. If your preference is to
have the Teams Live Meeting set to "**Sign-in required** ," it is recommended
to consider using the Windows or Linux device.

That's it!

Now you can assign this MS Teams Live app to your screens, or put it on a
schedule so the screens will join automatically when the event start.

**Tips:**

Have the host start the event a few mins before screens are joining
automatically.  
It will take a device 10-15s to join the event, so it's not a good idea to put
the MS Teams Live in a playlist. It's better to use it as single asset to take
up full screen or be part of a [SplitScreen
zone](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573).
