# How to mix playlists and maintain screen time share with OptiSigns Content Rotation App

**Important Note (7/3):** We have recently disabled our Content Rotation App,
and we highly recommend using our similar[**Sub-playlist Control
feature,**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/22474034993043)
available in our Pro-Plus and above plans.

Content Rotation App will allow you to mix content between 2 or more playlists
and ensure a distribution of screen time for each playlists.

A real world scenario would be: there are 2 Departments each maintain a
playlist: Department A and Department B.  
As Admin, you want both to have 50% of screen time each (i.e. ensure 1
department do not make long content, video and consume all the screen time).

With Content Rotation app, you can

## **Let's jump in and get started:**

First, you will need to have two or more playlists. For more information on
how to do that, click [here](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-
us/articles/28295104605843).

Go to Files/Assets, Click on "App".

Click Content Rotation app:

Click Add Playlist to add the playlist you want to rotate, in this example we
put 2 playlists: Department A, Department B. You can add as many playlist as
you want.

  * _Name_ : This is the name to organize assets, it will not be shown on the screen.
  * Add Playlist:

  *     * Playlist: Select your playlist.
    * Rotate Every*: 1 means the system will play 1 items on this playlist then move on to next playlist
    * Each Item Duration*: Set duration for each items, this is required in case one playlist has a very long video for example, this will ensure screen time is still allocated fairly between playlists.

  * Enforce each item duration limit: Force each asset's playing time is same as Each Item Duration time. When this is checked, you will need to select how you want to handle when an item's duration is less than "Each item duration": 
    * Move to next: If an item's duration is less than "Each item duration", it will move to next
    * Repeat: If an item's duration is less than "Each item duration", it will repeat the same asset until the "Each item duration" is over.

Click Save.  
After Saving, you can Preview the Content Rotation to see how the system mix
the playlist.

## **That's all! Congratulation!**

going to Screens, click Edit screens and assign the asset to screens that you
