For example if you set this value to 60 seconds. If a video is longer than 60s, it will get cut off at 60s to play next item. If a video is less than 60s, it will play the duration of the video.

by changing the name of the files in your Google Drive.

## **That's all! Congratulations!**

You have created your Google Drive app.  
You can change the wall any time by click on it in the Files/Assets tab.

You can assign the newly created wall to your screen by going to Screens,
click Edit screens and assign the wall to screens that you want.

You can put the created social walls in a Playlist, Schedule too.

**Notes:**

When files changes, add or removed from your Google Drive Folder, OptiSigns
will automatically sync the changes. You can check when's the last time
changed were made and what's the last file synced by opening the app modal
again.

You can also force refresh, sync by clicking the Refresh Data button.

**Limitations:**

  * Only image and video files are supported. If there are other files in the folder, they will be ignored. 
    * For images, only JPEG and PNG files are supported.
  * Be sure the names of your files do not have any common forbidden characters in your file names, e.g. '/', else the Drive may not load.
  * To ensure good performance of the app, max file size is limit at 100MB, and max number of files supported in folder is 200. If you have big video files, it's better to upload directly to OptiSigns; and if you have more than 200 files, you can split them up in multiple Google Drive folders.
