After Saving, you can Preview the Team chat. It may take several seconds for
the app to fetch posts and prepare your wall, so please be patient.

### Why does using Teams require giving OptiSigns Admin permission to use?

OptiSigns uses Microsoft APIs for integration. In order for our integrations
to work, the integration has to be approved by an administrator. This is the
same across all integrations using Microsoft APIs.

This administrator access is only needed for first time access. Once the
OptiSigns app is approved for use, other users can use OptiSigns directly.

### **That's all!**

Congratulation, you have created Microsoft Teams asset, now you can assign it
to your screens, playlist, schedule like any other assets.

OptiSigns, feel free to reach out to our support team at
