# How to use Facebook Live Stream App

This article will guide you through how to create and use Facebook Live Stream
app.

You can push a Facebook Live streams to all of your digital signs.

## **Let's jump in and get started:**

First, you will need to have your screens set up and paired. For more
information on how to do that, click

optisigns-and-amazon-fire-tv).

First open the Facebook live stream you want to use and copy the URL link:

Then log on to our portal: <http://app.optisigns.com/>

Go to Files/Assets, Click on "App" and add Instagram on your Account.

Click Facebook Live:

Enter your Facebook like URL:

  * _Name_ : Name of your Facebook Live Stream, this is the name of the wall in your asset list. It will  _**not**_ be displayed on your screens.

  * _Facebook Live Stream URL_ : Paste the URL of the Facebook live stream you want to use here.

  * _Mute:_ If you want to play the video muted.

Click Save.  
After Saving, you can Preview the wall.  
  

## **That's all! Congratulation!**

You have created your Facebook Live Stream app.

You can assign it to your screen by going to Screens, click Edit screens and
assign the wall to screens that you want.

## **Note:**

Facebook Live Stream URL will become a video on demand once the stream is
finished.  
So if the stream is already finished, the OptiSigns still get the video and
plays it.  
If you are following a Facebook Live Stream channel, each new stream session
is a new link, so you will have to copy, update the link every time.  
If you are producing live streams on Facebook, you can create, schedule the
link ahead of time.
