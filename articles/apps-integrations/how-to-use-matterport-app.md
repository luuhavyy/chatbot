# How to use Matterport App

Matterport is a very cool way to visualize, show case your facilities.

You can also share it on Digital Signage screens with OptiSigns.

To put Matterport on your Digital Signs:

Go to [app.optisigns.com](https://app.optisigns.com/).

Click Files/Assets, then click Apps

Search and click the Matterport app

Fill out:

  * Name: name of your Matterport App, this is only for use in File/Asset list, it will not be displayed on your screen.
  * URL:Your Matterport URL (e.x: <https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=tyEb2t1RWsc>)

Note that Matterport is very heavy app, it may overload older FireStick
devices. We recommend FireStick 4K max, our Android Stick device, or Windows
player for best performance.

Click Save to save your asset.

## That's all!

Congratulation! You have created your Matterport App.

You can change the app any time by click on it in the Files/Assets tab.
