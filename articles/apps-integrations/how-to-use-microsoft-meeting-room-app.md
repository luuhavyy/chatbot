### Why does using Meeting Room require giving OptiSigns Admin permission to
use?

OptiSigns uses Microsoft APIs for integration. In order for our integrations
to work, the integration has to be approved by an administrator. This is the
same across all integrations using Microsoft APIs.

This administrator access is only needed for first time access. Once the
OptiSigns app is approved for use, other users can use OptiSigns directly.
