# How to use Scrolling Website App

Sometimes you have requirement to show a certain website and have it scroll or
zoom in a certain way.  
Scrolling Website App is the solution for that, it will allow you to:

  * Use any Website URL
  * Set the app to scroll down & up the web page, or just scroll to a certain location
  * Set scrolling speed
  * Set the app to zoom in/out

## Let's jump in and get started:

Go to File/Asset -> App and select Scrolling Website App:

Set up your Scrolling Website App:

  * Name: name of your Scrolling Website App, this is only for use in File/Asset list, it will not be displayed on your screen.
  * URL: the URL link to the page you want to display.
  * Request Desktop Site: if you are using Amazon Fire Stick or Android as your player, if this box is checked, the app will try to request desktop version of the web page.
  * Scroll Type: You can select 
    *       *         * Down & Up: the app will scroll the web page down, and then scroll up.
        * Scroll to: the app will jump to a certain location on the web page
  * Speed: how fast you want to scroll, you can also customize the speed.
  * Page Height: enter the number in Pixel. This is needed because the app does not know how long a web page is, also some web page like social media has infinite scrolling.
