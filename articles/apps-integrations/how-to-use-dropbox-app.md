# How to use Dropbox App

With OptiSigns, you can quickly put images, videos from your Dropbox on your
Digital Signs screens by using Dropbox App. The app will create a playlist for
files in your Dropbox, any changes, updates, add, remove will automatically be
synced. This allow you to quickly update, share contents within your team
without needing to login to OptiSigns portal.

With the OptiSigns Dropbox app you can:

  * Connect to Dropbox and choose a folders with images, videos
  * Choose the timing, duration of your images/videos
  * Choose transition effect between your files

## **Let's jump in and get started:**

First, you will need to have your screens set up and paired. For more
information on how to do that, click
[here](https://www.optisigns.com/blog/how-to-set-up-digital-signs-with-
optisigns-and-amazon-fire-tv).

Then log on to our portal: <http://app.optisigns.com/>

Go to Files/Assets, Click on "App" and add Instagram on your Account.

Click Dropbox app:

Click "Sign in with Dropbox".

Sign in and allow OptiSigns to access your Dropbox.

Select the folder you want to use:

Enter information for your Dropbox app

  * _Name_ : Name of your Dropbox App, this is the name of the wall in your asset list. It will  _**not**_ be displayed on your screens.

  * _Transition Effect_ : Transition effect between your images, videos in the folder.

  * _Transition Speed:_ How fast you want your transitions to animate.

  * _Duration for Image_ : How long each images should show on your screen, default is 10 seconds.

  * _Max Video Duration:_ Default is 0, which means the app will play each video till the end. You can set it to some other values to prevent too long videos. For example if you set this value to 60 seconds. If a video is longer than 60s, it will get cut off at 60s to play next item. If a video is less than 60s, it will play the duration of the video.

Click Save.  
Depend on how many files you have in the folders, **it may take a moment** to
sync to OptiSigns, as all the files will be synced, copied to our servers.

Files will be sorted and played by name. You can control the order of playback
by changing the name of the files in your Dropbox.

## **That's all! Congratulations!**

You have created your Dropbox app.  
You can change the wall any time by click on it in the Files/Assets tab.

You can assign the newly created wall to your screen by going to Screens,
click Edit screens and assign the wall to screens that you want.

You can put the created social walls in a Playlist, Schedule too.

**Notes:**

When files changes, add or removed from your Dropbox Folder, OptiSigns will
automatically sync the changes. You can check when's the last time changed
were made and what's the last file synced by opening the app modal again.

You can also force refresh, sync by clicking the Refresh Data button.

**Limitations:**

  * Only image and video files are supported. If there are other files in the folder, they will be ignored.
  * To ensure good performance of the app, max size is limit at 100MB per file, and max number of files supported in folder is 200. If you have big video files, it's better to upload directly to OptiSigns; and if you have more than 200 files, you can split them up in multiple Dropbox folders.
  * The Dropbox app with Teams features requires a workaround to use properly, as it uses a different API from personal accounts. To get around this limitation: 
    * **Create a personal folder** within your Dropbox account and upload your content there. You should then be able to create and access it within the **OptiSigns portal**.
