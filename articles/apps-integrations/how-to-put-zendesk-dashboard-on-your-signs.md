# How to put ZenDesk Dashboard on your signs

This article will guide you through how to create and use a Zendesk App.

## Let's jump in and get started:

Go to App screen and select Zendesk:

Fill out:

  * Name: name of your Zendesk App, this is only for use in File/Asset list, it will not be displayed on your screen.
  * URL: the URL link to the Zendesk dashboard you want to display.
  * Update interval: default is 10 minutes. This means the app will refresh the link every 10 mins for any changes in your presentation. If you have a lot of slides, you may want to change this interval to something longer.

Click Save to save your asset.

## That's all!

Congratulation! You have created your Zendesk App.
