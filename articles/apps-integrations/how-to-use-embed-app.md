# How to use Embed App

Embed app is used to display embed codes that you get from the internet for
sharing content such as YouTube videos, Google Slides, Calendar, or social
media posts.

Here's an example of a shared Google Calendar embed code.

    
    
    <iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1/embed?height=1080&amp;wkst=1&amp;bgcolor=%234285F4&amp;ctz=America%2FChicago&amp;src=b3B0aXNpZ25zLmNvbV8zbmcyZXNmajA2dGk2cWgwNnJsNWNxMXY5b0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t&amp;src=ZW4udXNhI2hvbGlkYXlAZ3JvdXAudi5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t&amp;color=%233F51B5&amp;color=%230B8043&amp;mode=WEEK" style="border-width:0" width="1920" height="1080" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
