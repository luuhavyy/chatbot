# How to use Advanced Website App

Sometimes you have requirement to show a certain website and have it scroll or
zoom in a certain way.  
Advanced Website App is the solution for that, it will allow you to:

  * Set the app to scroll down & up the web page, or just scroll to a certain location
  * Set scrolling speed
  * Set the app to zoom in/out

## Let's jump in and get started:

Go to File/Assets -> App, search and select Advanced Website App:

Set up your Advanced Website App:

  * Name: name of your Advanced Website App, this is only for use in File/Asset list, it will not be displayed on your screen.
  * URL: the URL link to the page you want to display.
  * Scroll Type: You can select 
    *       *         * Down & Up: the app will scroll the web page down, and then scroll up.
        * Scroll to: the app will jump to a certain location on the web page
  * Speed: how fast you want to scroll, you can also customize the speed.
  * Page Height: enter the number in Pixel. This is needed because the app does not know how long a web page is, also some web page like social media has infinite scrolling.
  * Zoom: depend on what kind of your website's content, zoom may help the content to be displayed better on your screens.
  * Update interval: default is 10 minutes. This means the app will refresh the link every 10 mins for any changes of your website.

You can click Advanced and set:

  * Preload: if you want to show your Advanced Website App to user instantly (when you put it in a playlist), you can set preload value (by seconds), the app will preload the URL in the background.
  * Render Engine: if your website is not displayed as expected, you can change between three different webview: Normal, CrossWalk or Advanced Webview on FireStick Normal, FireStick 4K or Other devices.
