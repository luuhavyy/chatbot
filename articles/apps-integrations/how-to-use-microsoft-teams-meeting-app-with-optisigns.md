# How to use Microsoft Teams Meeting app with OptiSigns

You can broadcast a Microsoft Teams meeting on your digital signs with
OptiSigns.

It's simple, create (or schedule a MS Teams meeting).

In the Meeting Options:

Make sure you set "Who can bypass the lobby" to "Everyone".

Otherwise OptiSigns app will stuck at the lobby.

After that, copy your MS Team's URL.

There are many ways you can copy the MS Teams Meeting URL. Here' one:  
Click Participants, then click Share Invite. Then click Copy Link

Log in to OptiSigns:  
<https://app.optisigns.com/app/assetManagement>

Click Files/Assets -> Apps -> and select Microsoft Teams Meetings

Give your MS Teams Meeting app a name and paste the URL in there:

That's it!

Now you can assign this MS Teams Meeting app to your screens, or put it on a
schedule so the screens will join automatically when the meeting start.

The screens will join the meeting as Guests with names are the name of the
screens.

This can also be done with Teams Town hall. To enable Town hall, simply hit
**Share Event** , then copy the **Join****link** URL and paste this into
OptiSigns.

**Tips:**

Have the host start the meeting a few mins before screens are joining
automatically.  
It will take a device 10-15s to join the meeting, so it's not a good idea to
put the Teams Meeting in a playlist. It's better to use it as single asset to
take up full screen or be part of a [SplitScreen
zone](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573).
