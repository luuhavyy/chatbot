Google has renamed Google Data Studio to Looker Studio.

Simply open your Looker Studio Dashboard. Click Share, then Embed.

Then click **Enable Embedding** -> **Embed Code**  
Change Width to **1920** , Height to **1080** (best resolution for Digital
Signs, you can use 4K if your TV and player support it, it may make the text a
bit too small to read).  
Then click "Copy to Clipboard"

Next, hit the **Share** button. You'll need to make the report access
**Public** for it to be properly displayed via OptiSigns.

Now you are ready to put this Embed Code to OptiSigns and display on your
