4) Set **Apps from Unknown Sources** to ON.

5) **Accept the warning message** about installing external apps

6) Next is to download and install OptiSigns' APK app.

  * Open the **Amazon appstore** on your Fire TV.
  * Search for [Downloader](https://www.amazon.com/AFTVnews-com-Downloader/dp/B01N0BP507) and install the program.

  * **Open Downloader and type in the URL:<https://links.optisigns.com/fireos>**
