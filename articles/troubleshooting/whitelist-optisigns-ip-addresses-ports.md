**IMPORTANT NOTE:** we use CDN to optimize file distribution to your devices.
Some firewalls may block CDNs. If you experiencing issues where your device is
online, but when you assign files, it's just a black screen because the device
cannot download files. You can contact us at
[support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com) to disable the CDN
feature for your account. (Note: It requires the Engage or Enterprise Plan)

There's no set of IP addresses for Social Media and some other apps like
Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Google Calendar, so if you restrict HTTPS
access by IP, you may not be able to use those apps.
