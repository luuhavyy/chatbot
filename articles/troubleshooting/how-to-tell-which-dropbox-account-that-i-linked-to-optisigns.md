# How to tell which Dropbox account that I linked to OptiSigns?

Quickest way is to sign out and sign in again with the right account.  

If you do want to know which account is connected to, go to your Dropbox
account.

Click Settings, connected app, and see if it has "File Stack" there. We use
File Stack to handle the integration.
