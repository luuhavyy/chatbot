# I received the OptiSigns device but it's OnHold and cannot assign content

## Issue:

You ordered an OptiSigns Android Stick device and:

  * After ordered devices, devices are in OnHold folder and you cannot assign content to it
  * Or after plugging it in, you see screens “Paired” screen or “OnHold screen"

##

## Reason

OnHold is a special folder, devices in OnHold folder is not counting toward
license and is not useable.

Likely reason:

  * You added test screens during trial, testing process (like your laptop)
  * You ordered more devices than you have license for (possible for future deployment)

## How to solve this?

If you have screens that you added during Trial process to test out (like your
laptop etc.)

You can remove them, and reuse the license.

Or you can [increase more
licenses](https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/subscription-plan) if that's what
you need.

Open the OnHold Device folder and see if there are any devices listed

##

Now to move the screen that you want to move outside the Onhold Device folder.
Go to the onhold device folder, click on edit on the screen and select Move.
This will move the device out of the onhold Device folder.

Congratulations!! your screen should now be ready to use.
