1\. Go to Home Page and scroll right to "**Settings** "

2\. Click "**My Fire TV** " in the Settings

3\. Then Select "**About** "

4\. Click "**Install Update** "

The FireStick update will now start. It may take some times to download and
update your Fire Stick

Once it is updated, your Fire Stick will automatically restart. When you check
for its Fire OS, you will find that a new version is installed.

If your device hasnâ€™t restarted, you can do it manually by pressing on the
**Middle** button and **Play/Pause** button at the same time and hold it for 5
seconds.
