# Apple TV player release notes & limitations

Apple TV is a powerful & reliable device.

There are a few notes in running Apple TV as digital signage player.

**Release notes:**

  * Apple does not recommend using Apple TV to play websites. Some website may not display properly, and Apple may remove support for displaying websites in the future. We do not have control over Apple's roadmap.
  * Similarly, we don't recommend using the Aericast app add-on on Apple TV. This will cause the pairing code to not be entered correctly
  * More than 3-4 zones with heavy websites (like PowerBI dashboard) may result in crashing or freezing.

**OptiSigns Player on Apple TV supports:**

  * Images, Videos, Documents, GIF Files
  * Canvas, Templates, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive apps
  * Playlist, Schedule
  * Portrait, Landscape mode, screen rotation
  * Most Social Media, YouTube, News, Streaming videos, etc.
  * Kiosks and Engage features
  * SplitScreen display, with sound priority by screenzone
