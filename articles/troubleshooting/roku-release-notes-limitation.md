# Roku Release Notes & Limitation

Updated Sep 2023. After Roku OS 12.0.0 updates, Roku is enforcing stricter to
power management & screensaver.

Roku platform has a lot of restrictions. **In short, if you just need to
display static menus or simple slideshows, and don't mind spending sometime
setting it up, then it's OK.**

For better compatibility and reliability, we recommend a dedicated player like
our [Android Stick Player](https://links.optisigns.com/szzk) or Google
ChromeCast, or any [Windows, Mac, Linux](https://www.optisigns.com/download)
devices.

Since Roku is a device designed for streaming, it's limited in processing
power, storage and capability. This article describe the limitation in term of
using the device for Digital Signage application.

**1) OptiSigns App on Roku supports:**

  * Images, Videos, Documents
  * Canvas, Templates, Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive apps
  * Playlist, Schedule
  * Portrait, Landscape mode, screen rotation

**2) Not supported:**(these are the limitation specific to Roku Platform)

  * All other apps such as Social Media, Youtube, News, Streaming videos, etc.
  * SplitScreen display.
  * Roku has small storage, be mindful of how much content you would like to cache on it.
  * Advanced features of playlists such as shuffle, and background music.
  * Advanced features of the designer tool such as animations, transitions, and widgets. 
  * Advanced features of schedules such as default content. 

**How to install OptiSigns Player on Roku:**
