# Difference between Instagram & Instagram Business App

**NOTE**  
---  
To set up an Instagram Business account, we recommend following [this article
on Instagram's website](https://help.instagram.com/502981923235522).  
  
As result of Facebook's change in policies, Instagram Consumer and Instagram
Business/Creator have different level of access.

**Instagram (or Instagram Consumer):**

  * Display posts in your profiles only.

**Instagram Business/Creator:**

  * Display post from your profiles
  * You can display posts from any public profiles (i.e. <https://www.instagram.com/arsenal>)
  * You can also follow, monitor up to 30 hashtags
  * Get follower counts (for [Instagram Counter App](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047501233))
