# How to re-encode video files for better compatibility on your devices

Amazon Fire TV, Android or Roku rely on Hardware decode to decode your videos
files.

Most of the time it should be OK, however, there could be times when codec is
not recognized or support by your devices.

For example, here's a link to Amazon's [_supported
codec_](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/device-specifications.html)
or [Roku supported codec.](https://developer.roku.com/en-
gb/docs/specs/streaming.md)

To solve the problem you will need to convert/re-encode your video into
something that Amazon, Android or Roku device support.

There's a [_Handbreak is a free_](https://handbrake.fr/) and very popular
software to do that. It runs on Windows, Mac and Linux.

To re-encode your video.

Download, Run Handbreak.

Drag your video in there.

Select the output format you desired. Amazon, Android or Roku, depend on your
device. Pick appropriate video resolution you want too.

Select a location you want the new video file to be output to.

Click Start.

Depend on video length and quality, and how fast your computer is. It could
take some time.

When it's done, you can upload the file back to OptiSigns and assign to your
playlists, screens.
