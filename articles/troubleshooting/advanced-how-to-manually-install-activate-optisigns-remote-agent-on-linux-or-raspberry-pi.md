# Advanced: How to Manually Install & Activate OptiSigns Remote Agent on Linux or Raspberry Pi

### In this article, we will show you how to complete a manual installation of
the OptiSigns Remote Agent on a Linux or Raspberry Pi device.

If you're running OptiSigns on a Windows, Linux or Raspberry Pi device, you
can install optisigns-remote-agent add-on that will allow you to remotely
control your device from the portal.

If you have not tried to automatically activate this feature, please try it
first by following [this guide](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360055486554).

If automatic activation fails, follow these steps to manually install &
activate the OptiSigns remote agent on your Linux or Raspberry Pi device.

**Before you start, please ensure that:**

  * Your device has OptiSigns Digital Signage player installed. Download the latest version [here](https://www.optisigns.com/download).
  * Your device has an active network connection.
  * You have the authorization and privileges to install apps and background services on your device.

**NOTE**  
---  
The Remote Control feature is only available to subscribers with a **Pro
Plus****plan or above.**  
  
## **How to manually install optisigns-remote-agent**

Open Terminal.

On Raspberry Pi run:

    
    
    curl -s https://release.optisigns.com/optisigns-remote-agent-setup-rpi.sh -L | sh

On Linux run:

    
    
    curl -s https://release.optisigns.com/optisigns-remote-agent-setup-linux.sh -L | sh

Player and still running in case the Player encounters an issue, or you need
to reinstall it.
