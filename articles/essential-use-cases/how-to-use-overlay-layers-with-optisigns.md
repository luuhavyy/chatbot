# How to use Overlay layers with OptiSigns

With OptiSigns SplitScreen, you can overlay items on top of each other.  
In example below we overlay OptiSigns Logo and a QR Code on top of the screen.  
As the content play, the logo keep staying on top.  
This is particular useful if you want to overlay logo, QR Codes, but you can
overlay any content.

To create overlay layer, use the Split Screen app. If you haven't use the
Split Screen app before, you can read the [how to
here.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573)

In SplitScreen Editor, you just need to add 1 more zone by clicking the +
button.  
The move, resize the zone to the area you want.  
For example below, we made a small Orange zone for our overlay logo.  
Then set that zone to display the logo.

You can bring the zone layer Forward, Backward, etc to set overlay layers by
using these buttons.

Tips: use a transparent PNG image if you want to have transparent background.  
Note: Transparent PNG background currently only work for Windows, Linux, Mac,
Raspberry Pi. On Android & FireTV it will show as black background.
