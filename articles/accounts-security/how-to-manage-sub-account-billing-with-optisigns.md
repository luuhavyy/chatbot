# How to manage Sub-Account billing with OptiSigns

OptiSigns supports managing billing for sub-accounts. With this feature,
headquarters/corporate can manage the billing & payment on behalf of the
subsidiaries, like franchisees or different departments. For example, a branch
manages the account and screens on its own, but corporates can set up the
subaccount and add payment methods for local branches.  
  
**Important Note** : Sub-account is a separate account, so **screens** ,
**contents** , **playlists,** and **schedules** are segregated in the
subaccount. The sub-account billing feature is only to support the main
account to manage the billing and payment for the sub-account.

If you would like to manage the recourses in the "sub-account" instead, we
suggest that you use the "[**Teams**](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360034883113)" feature so that you can reserve the screens per
team, and then allocate the cost by the number of screens.

If you are a very large franchise or, organizations that need over 50+ sub-
accounts, please reach out to us we have a team billing feature that may be
more suitable for you.

## **Let's jump in and get started:**

Log on to our portal: <https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/sub-account-billing>

Go to "**Sub-Account Billing** " and Click "**Add Sub-account** "

You will have two options.

  * Link an existing OptiSigns account | Click Link Account
  * Create a new sub-account for your new department | Create New Account

Once you link to the account, it will send the email notification to that
email account.

After the sub-account approve the request. It will show the subscription
detail.

You can update the payment method for the sub-account.

You can only do these for your sub-account

  * Update the subscription plan
  * See the payment history
  * Update the billing email
  * Update the billing information
  * Update the billing address

**Important Note** : Sub-account is a separate account. The main account can
update the billing info for the sub-account. All screens, contents, playlists,
and schedules will not be able to be shared between the main account and the
sub-account.
