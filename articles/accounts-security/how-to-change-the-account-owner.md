# How to Change the Account Owner

Account Owner is a special role. Only Account Owners can request deletion of
accounts.  
There's only 1 Owner per account.

You can change owner to another user/admin in OptiSigns by:

  * Go to the [Account Member](https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/account-members) page:
  * Click the **Change Role** icon on the user or admin that you want to change to Owner.

  * Modify the Change role to the "**Owner** " role, and update it.

  * It will pop out a warning message. If you confirm it, please type "**CONTINUE** " and click OK to continue.

### ****

### **That's all!**

You have changed the owner to another account successfully.

**Note** :

You can change back by asking the new Owner to make you Owner again.
