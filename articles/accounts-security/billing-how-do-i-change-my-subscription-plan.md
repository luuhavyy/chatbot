# Billing: How Do I Change my Subscription Plan?

### In this article, we will cover how to change the subscription plan on your
OptiSigns account.

  * From Free Trial
  * From Existing Paid Subscription

It's extremely easy to change the details of your OptiSigns subscription. From
the type of plan you're using, to the number of screens associated with the
account, to the add-on licenses you've purchased, all of this can be managed
on the Subscription Plan screen.

In addition, you can change payment terms from Monthly to Yearly and vice
versa. Our billing system will prorate your charges as appropriate.

#### **To make changes to your plan, please go to:**

## From a Free Trial Account

For a free trial account, you can update your subscription at any time by
clicking **Update subscription**.

Add the **Number of screens** , then hit **Next.**

Select the plan you want to change your Trial account to. For more on this,
see our [pricing page](https://www.optisigns.com/pricing). Once you've made a
decision, hit **Next**.

Then, choose your Term.

Currently (as of late 2024), we offer two terms:

  * **Monthly:** A straight fee, paid each month. The most basic subscription type.
  * **Yearly:** A commitment to pay for a single screen for a year, but with a 10% discount.

Choose whichever you prefer, then hit **Next**.

You'll be asked to input your payment information. Do so, then hit **Update
subscription**.

Once that's done, you'll see an itemized breakdown, showing your plan, the
number of screens, the Subtotal, the amount paid in Sales Tax (varies by
location), and an estimate for your next bill.

Finally, hit **Continue**.

Congratulations! You've subscribed to OptiSigns.

hit **Update subscription**.

plan.
