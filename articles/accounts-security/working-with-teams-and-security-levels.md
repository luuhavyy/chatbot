# Working with Teams and Security Levels

With OptiSigns, you can set up Teams, invite other users / account members and
set security levels.  
Team(like workspace) is built for segregation, all the resources (Screens,
Assets, Users etc) in a team are segregated from other teams. Account owner
will have access to all the teams, if you need to act as a global
administrator and have access to all the teams, you can use the Super Admin
role for that purpose.

**NOTE**  
---  
Teams can only be added under the **Pro Plus****plan** or above. Free and
Standard plan users can still Add/Invite members to the Default team.  
  
This article will guide you through how to work with Teams, and set security
for your account.

**Quick start:**

  * Teams: You can organize our account by Teams. 
    * Each team can have multiple members, and their own screens, files, assets, etc. Other teams cannot see another team's data.
    * Admins can allocate # of screens quota to each team.
  * Team members: 
    * Admins can invite users to be members of teams. Team members can work on team's screen, files, assets, etc.
    * One users can belong to more than 1 team, and can switch around to manage screens of the teams they are assigned to.
  * Security level: there are 2 security levels 
    * Admin: can add, remove users to teams
    * User: can work on the team's screens, files, assets, etc. but cannot see subscription, billing information.

**Next, we will guide you through details how to:**

  * Create/Edit a team, assign quota, limits to the team
