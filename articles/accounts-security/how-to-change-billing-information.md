# How to change Billing information

You can go to Payment Settings to change your billing information. You will be
able to change and maintain your billing email, payment method, billing
address, and tax ID. To do so, you can simply go to
<https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/payment>

or you can find it here:  

#### **Change Billing email**

Expand the Billing Email section, just add the email address and hit the
Update Email button. The billing email associated with the account will be
updated.  

#### **Add/Change Payment Method**

Expand the Billing Information section, you can change your payment method
here.

#### **Add/Change Billing Address**

Expand the Billing Information section, and click the Update Billing Address
button, you will be able to add or update your billing address.

####

#### **Add/Change Tax ID**

If you are not located in the US and need a VAT invoice, you will need to
maintain the VAT ID here. The Billing Address needs to be maintained first
before you can maintain a Tax ID.  
Expand the Tax ID section, select the corresponding Tax ID type, and put your
Tax ID here, then click the save button, and your Tax ID will be updated.

**That's all!**
