# How to Delete Your Account from OptiSigns

When you delete your account, all your data, images, videos, assets,
playlists, schedules, proof of play, etc. will be permanently deleted. Please

your account has been deleted, you will not have access to your account.

  * Go to the [Company Setting](https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/company-profile) page from a browser.

  * Click the **Delete Account** button. 
  * It will pop out a warning message. To confirm it, please type "**DELETE** " and click OK to continue.
