# How to add a Microsoft 365 Excel Spreadsheet as a DataSource for OptiSync

## Adding Your Excel Spreadsheet as a DataSource

There are two different methods to adding Excel Spreadsheet to your
DataSources:

**IMPORTANT NOTE**  
---  
OptiSync does not currently (as of 1/15/2025) support Excel's date formatting.
In order for dates to properly display, they will need to be redone in TEXT
format, or use a formula (like =TEXT(A1, "mm/dd/yy")) to convert them.  
  
#### **Method 1: Through Designer**

  * On the Files/Assets page, select **Designer** from the Apps
  * Select **DataSource** on the side menu, then **Add DataSource**
  * Click **Microsoft 365 Excel**
  * Grant access to your Microsoft 365 Excel by **signing in** when prompted
  * Find and select your Excel spreadsheet from the Microsoft pop-up window 
    * If your spreadsheet has multiple sheets, select the one you want to import from the drop-down menu
  * Click **Import Data**
  * Double check your table, select **Update**
  * **Name** your DataSource something easily recognizable
  * Select your Synchronization and Update Interval
  * Click **Done**

**Method 2: Through Account Settings**

  * In our portal, select your account name, then **More** , then **DataSources**
  * Click **Microsoft 365 Excel**
  * Grant access to your Microsoft 365 Excel by **signing in** when prompted
  * Find and select your Excel spreadsheet from the Microsoft pop-up window 
    * If your spreadsheet has multiple sheets, select the one you want to import from the drop-down menu
  * Click **Import Data**
  * Double check your table, select **Update**
  * **Name** your DataSource something easily recognizable
  * Select your Synchronization and Update Interval
  * Click **Done**

**Synchronization**

  * **Only once import:** This option imports the data only once when you add the DataSource. After the initial import, the data will not be updated automatically.
  * **Periodic direct access:** This option regularly fetches the latest data directly from the device through your gateway, providing "live access" to the data and ensuring you have the most up-to-date information available directly from the device. 
    * _This is better for more consistent update intervals, but could cause performance issues._
  * **Periodic background sync:** This option periodically syncs data to your server in the background at regular intervals, reducing the need for direct queries to the device.

**IMPORTANT**  
---  
OptiSync does not support special characters (i.e. anything outside the scope
of an English-language keyboard). This will cause the system data to read as
blank, and it will not show.  
  
**Update Interval**

The duration of time between updates if you chose "Periodic direct access" or
"Periodic background sync"

  * None _(Your Datasource will import with the newest data available, but will not continuously update afterward. You will have to force refresh data for new updates.)_
  * 30 minutes
  * 1 hour
  * 8 hours
