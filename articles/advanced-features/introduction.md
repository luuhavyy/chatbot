# Introduction

The OptiSigns API is organized around GraphQL. GraphQL is a query language for
API, it provides a complete and understandable description of the data in API,
gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more,
makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer
tools.

### Why GraphQL

#### Only one API endpoint

GraphQL APIs are organized in terms of types and fields, not endpoints. Access
the full capabilities of your data from a single endpoint. GraphQL uses types
to ensure Apps only ask for whatâ€™s possible and provide clear and helpful
errors. Apps can use types to avoid writing manual parsing code.

#### Get many resources in a single request

GraphQL queries access not just the properties of one resource but also
smoothly follow references between them. While typical REST APIs require
loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a
single request. Apps using GraphQL can be quick even on slow mobile network
connections.

#### No over-fetching and under-fetching

Send a GraphQL query to your API and get exactly what you need, nothing more
and nothing less. GraphQL queries always return predictable results. Apps
using GraphQL are fast and stable because they control the data they get, not
the server.

#### No Versioning

New fields and types can be added to GraphQL API without impacting existing
queries. Aging fields can be deprecated and hidden from tools. By using a
single evolving version, GraphQL APIs give apps continuous access to new
features and encourage cleaner, more maintainable server code.

### OptiSigns API endpoint

The GraphQL API can be accessed using the endpoint.
