# How to Lockdown iPad/Single App with Guided Accessibility

This article will guide you on how to activate the kiosk mode on your iPad for
a specific application.

This can be particularly beneficial if you intend to use the OptiSigns
software as a kiosk device, ensuring that the OptiSigns application remains
open and cannot be exited without authorization.

## Lockdown app on iPad Settings

Go to **Settings** , select **Accessibility** , then **Guided Access**

Tap **Enable Guided Access** , then tap **Passcode Settings**

Tap **Set Guided Access Passcode**. Enter a passcode, then re-enter it

Open the app you want to lockdown: **OptiSigns App**

Triple-click the **Top** (If there is no home button) or **Home** button to
start lockdown  
note: Please make sure the orientation is in portrait mode if no home button
exists

To end **Guided Access** , triple-click the **Top** or**Home** button enter
your passcode, and tap **End**

That's it! Now, the OptiSigns app will be locked on your screen.

**Note:** Users will still be able to mess with the OptiSigns side menu.
