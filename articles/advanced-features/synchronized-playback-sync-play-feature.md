# Synchronized playback (Sync Play) feature

With OptiSigns you can enable screens to play in-sync. This means:

  * If content published screens are **the same** , all screens will play the content at the same time.
  * If content published screens are **different** , it will start playing them from the beginning

Supported on: Android, Fire TV, Windows, Linux, MacOS, ChromeOS, Webplayer

Note:

  * When Sync Play enabled, playlists may not start from the beginning (because they are synced).
  * Devices do not need to be on the same network, nor there's any special configuration needed on devices.
  * Devices time need to be updated, and devices needs to be in the same time zone.
  * Android, Fire TV requires updates to 5.13.7 or newer.
  * Windows, Linux, MacOS, ChromeOS, and Webplayer don't have the timer server setting yet. 

To use the Sync Play feature, just select the screens you want to enable this
feature for.

### 1\. Click **Edit** -> **Advanced** -> check **Sync Play**

### 2\. Open the side menu of the OptiSigns app on your screen. Go to the Sync
Play Timeserver.

####

**

**  
**2-2. Set other devices to**Default**

Or **Client**. Make sure all other devices connect to the same IP Server.

Another option: If you cannot find any server, you can set all devices to
Google NTP.

### That's it. All screens will sync up.
