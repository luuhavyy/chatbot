# How to mass deploy OptiSigns on Raspberry Pi devices

Do you have already a large number of Raspberry Pi devices and would like to
run OptiSigns on them?

With the Advanced Device Management & Mass Preconfigure feature you will be
able to:

  * Mass-create devices on your OptiSigns Portal
  * Push pairing code to your Raspberry Pi via a text file
  * Download and launch OptiSigns so that it will utilize the pairing code pre-assigned.
  * If you setting up new devices, you can preconfigure the SD Cards.
  * If your devices are already on the fields, all deployment operations can be done via SSH command lines, no GUI access is needed

This feature is only available for the Enterprise plan. Please contact
[support@optisigns.com](mailto:support@optisigns.com) if you are interested in
this feature.
