# Subscription Function in GraphQL

Subscriptions are a query type that allows you to be notified when any changes
are made to a device, asset, or playlist.

An example might be that you want to be notified of any changes made to your
device, be that changing the asset or playlist. This can be done entirely
within GraphQL by using queries to find the information about a device,
setting up a subscription, then using mutations to alter the device
attributes.

### **1\. Set Up the Subscription**

    
    
    subscription subscribe($_id:String,$type:OBJECT_TYPES){  
      
      subscribe(_id:$_id,type:$type){  
      
        _id,  
      
        mutation,  
      
        teamId  
      
        type  
      
      }  
      
    }

**Variables**

    
    
    {"_id":"",  
      
      "type": ""  
      
    }

Note the elements present in the Subscription query. These are the elements it
will monitor, and return to you when any of them are changed via Mutation.

When a Subscription is properly input, you should see this on the right side
of the GraphQL UI:

This means, as long as the Subscription is active, it will report any changes
to the item.

### **2\. Testing the Subscription**

Here, we have a Mutation script that is changing the name and playlist on the
selected device.

    
    
    mutation updateDevice($_id: String!,$payload: UpdateDeviceInput!, $teamId: String){  
      updateDevice(_id:$_id,payload:$payload,teamId:$teamId){  
         _id,  
         deviceName,  
         UUID,  
         pairingCode,  
         currentType,  
         currentAssetId,  
         currentPlaylistId,  
         path,  
         localAppVersion  
      }  
    }

**Variables**

    
    
    {"_id": "",  
      "payload": {"deviceName": "",  
        "currentType": "",  
        "currentAssetId": “”,  
        "currentPlaylistId": "",  
        "orientation": "LANDSCAPE"  
      }   
    } 

When we perform this Mutation, we can switch over to where our Subscription is
