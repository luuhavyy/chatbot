# How to use AeriCast Add-on for Wireless Presentation and Video Conferencing

With the AeriCast add-on, you can turn any conference room TV into a digital
sign. Aericast also allows user to present from their laptops to those screens
without needing cables, dongles or extra hardware.

With a USB webcam, mic and speakers connected to the OptiSigns Windows Player,
users can wirelessly link these devices and use them in the video conference.

It's done in three easy steps:

  1. Create AeriCast Wireless Presentation app in your "Files/Assets"
  2. Assign it to your screen
  3. Wirelessly mirror your screen from a [laptop](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/14502378549907) or [iOS/Android phone, tablet](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/14557706459283), or begin [AeriCast Add-on wireless conferencing](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/23030445716883/)

**Note:**  
All customers can use AeriCast add-on with a 14-day free trial.

The trial allows two free licenses of the AeriCast add-on. When the trial is
over, each created AeriCast add-on will cost $20 per month.

## **Let's Get Started:**

When pushed to a screen, the Aericast Screen Share app will appear like this
by default:

The app can also be placed at the bottom strip of a [Split
Screen](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573). This
allows the rest of your screen to be used as a sign when not in use:

## **Setting Up the Aericast Add-On:**

### 1\. Create AeriCast Wireless Presentation app

First, you will need to have your [screens set up and
paired](https://www.optisigns.com/blog/how-to-set-up-digital-signs-with-
optisigns-and-amazon-fire-tv).

Then log on to our portal: <http://app.optisigns.com/>

Go to **Files/Assets â†’** **"App"** and search for the **"AeriCast Wireless
Presentation"** app.

Enter your AeriCast Wireless Presentation app information:

  * **_Name_ :** Name of your AeriCast Wireless Presentation app, this is the name of the app in your asset list. It will _not_ be displayed on your screens.
  * **_Title_ :** Enter a title to be displayed on your screen. For example: "Welcome to Conf. Room N123"
  * **_Message_ :** Enter a message to be displayed on your screen. This could be anything: a fun workplace meme, a reminder message, or instructions on how to use the room.
  * **_Expires in_ :** The 4 digit presenter codes are set to expire every 10 minutes by default. This is to prevent someone saving the code and using it days or weeks later.
  * **Background Playlist:** By default, the app plays a few images in the background. This is for aesthetics, and also to prevent your screen from developing stuck pixels. You can customize what images play here with a Playlist. Note: only images will be played.
  * **Background Opacity :** This appears only when a Playlist is selected and allows the user to change the opacity of the background so that the text still stands out effectively.
  * **Text Color :** Default is white, but if you'd like another color, this option provides them.
  * **Different Presenter Code for each screens** : When you assign any device, the pairing code will be different on different devices. 

**NOTE:** The **Different Presenter Code for Each Screens** option is only
supported on the PAID Aericast subscription. If you want to show the same
Presenter Code across multiple screens, it can only be done with a paid
subscription.

  * **Instruction 2****:** The default message is "present.optisigns.com," this can be changed to whatever you like.
  * **Instruction 3 :** The default message is "and enter the code below to start presenting," this can be changed to whatever you like.

Click **Save**.  
After saving, you can **P****review** the wall. It may take several seconds
for the app to load.

### 2\. Assign it to your screen
