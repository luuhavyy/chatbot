# Present / share your screen with OptiSigns & AeriCast Add-on

In this article, we will guide you on how to present/ share from your laptop
to your screen.

On your TVs running OptiSigns, you should see 4 digit presenter codes like
below:  
  
Or at the bottom strip:  

You can click [here](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-
us/articles/14502723487379) to know how to create the AeriCast Wireless
Presentation app

## **Let's jump in and get started:**

Go to [present.aericast.com ](https://present.aericast.com/)(we recommend
Chrome or FireFox for best experience).

Enter the 4 digit codes

Click Continue

Now presenter is connected to the room, just click Present to start sharing
screen.

You can select sharing:

  * Your entire screen (you will need to select the screen then click share, see 1, 2 in below screenshot)
  * A certain Application
  * Or a certain Tab on your Browser

You can stop presenting by click either the "Stop" button or "Stop Sharing"
button.

If there are more than 1 presenters, you can share the Presenter Code with
your colleague so they can join the room as presenters.

When there are more than 1 presenters, the app will show the list of
presenters, and when it's your turn to present, you can stop the current
presenters and then share your screen.

### That's all!

You can also present from iOS, Android phone, or tablet to your screen. Click
