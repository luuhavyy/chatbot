# Display PowerPoint/Google Slides in whole screen when casting from MacBook Pro

In this article, we will show you if you try to present your MacBook Pro to
AeriCast Add-on app via OptiSigns app. There is an extra black space on your
screen. It is because the MacBook Pro is 16:10 in resolution. Most TV screens
are 16:9.

Here is the suggestion:

1\. Upload the PowerPoint file to Microsoft 365 or Google Slides. Open the
file in Microsoft365/Google Slides in the web browser. Go to
<https://present.aericast.com> and present the specific browser "tab" of the M
365/Google Slides page, instead of the whole screen. Then resize the browser
window to fit the presentation slide content, assuming it's 16:9 based. This
will cast the presentation to the entire TV screen without additional blank
spaces.

2\. Change MacBook Pro's resolution to a 16:9 based resolution during the
presentation, but this may require a 3rd party app to do so. => This is
Apple's limitation.
