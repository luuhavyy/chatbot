# Setting Up Your Samsung Smart Signage Platform (SSSP - Commercial Grade)

### Samsung Smart Signage Platform —SSSP— powered displays are one of the most
popular commercial grade TVs. OptiSigns supports Samsung SSP devices natively.
Nearly all features are supported, including offline playback and auto update
of the OptiSigns app. Getting your SSSP with OptiSigns is an easy process!

**This article is for installing OptiSigns on Samsung SSP devices only!**  
---  
Your screen should be marked as "SSSP/Samsung Smart Signage Platform". Samsung
has other product lines that run on Tizen OS, and aren't SSSPs. Not sure if
your Samsung Smart TV is an SSP or uses Tizen OS? Check out our **[Full List

## OptiSigns Installation Process

The installation process to get OptiSigns on your SSSP is easy! There are two
different scenarios for you:

  * **Install on a SSSP display that is already in use:** You already have SSSP display in use and would like to have OptiSigns player for SSSP deployed.
  * **Install on a brand new SSSP display through out of box experience setup:** You have a brand new SSSP display or you just performed a factory reset. You can connect to OptiSigns through the out of box experience/initial set-up process.

_For a detailed visual guide for these options, please watch and follow along
with our SSSP installation instructional video:_

## Limitations

Samsung SSP graphics resolution output is 1080P only. Take precaution when
using 4k videos. Samsung SSP can only process a single video at any point of
time. Preloading of the next video is not allowed. The transition from video
to video is not as smooth as other players that allow video preloading.
