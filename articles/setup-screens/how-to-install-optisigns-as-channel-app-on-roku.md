# How to install OptiSigns as channel/app on Roku

Updated Sep 2023: After Roku OS 12.0.0 updates, Roku is more strict with power
management and screensaver feature.  
---  
  
Roku platform has a lot of restrictions. **In short, if you just need to
display static menus or simple slideshows, and don't mind spending some time
setting it up, then it's OK.**

For better compatibility and reliability, we recommend a dedicated player like
our [Android Stick Player,](https://links.optisigns.com/szzk) Google
ChromeCast, or any [Windows, Mac, Linux](https://www.optisigns.com/download)
devices.
