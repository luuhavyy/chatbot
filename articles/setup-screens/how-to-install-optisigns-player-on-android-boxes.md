# How to install OptiSigns Player on Android Boxes

There are many cost effective Android Boxes or Sticks on the market, such as
Xiaomi boxes, sticks, Onn TV box, Mecool, etc.

In general, we recommend using [OptiSigns Android

performance and stability.

If you're not in the region where OptiSigns Players are available, we
recommend Google Chromecast.

system updates also varies, so please test before you use. Note that if
manufacturers push updates, you may need to test it again in the future.
