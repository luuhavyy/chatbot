#### Pick one of the 3 ways below to get OptiSigns running on your TV:

  1. The easiest way to get started is to get your favorite brand of TV and get our**[OptiSigns Android Digital Signage Player](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-android-stick-player-2)** to run OptiSigns on it. Follow **[this guide](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/27267311796243)** to learn how to set up your OptiSigns Player
  2. Already have a TV or Signage Player? Go to our**[Downloads](https://www.optisigns.com/download)** page to see if our app can be installed on it.
  3. Not ready for hardware purchase yet? Just download the **[Windows Player app](https://links.optisigns.com/win)** or **[MacOS Player app](https://links.optisigns.com/mac)** and use your laptop as test screen.

Once OptiSigns App is installed, **launch it**.

The app will ask if you want to automatically start when the device starts up.

Then, you will see this **pairing screen:**

Go to the OptiSigns portal: <https://app.optisigns.com/>

Once logged in, click **Add Screen.**

A pop-up screen will appear, type in the **Pair Code** showing up on your
screen. Then, click **Pair**.

Your screen should now say **Paired** , instead of showing the code.
