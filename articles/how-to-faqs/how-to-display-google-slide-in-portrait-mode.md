# How to display Google Slide in Portrait Mode

You can set up Google Slides to present properly in Portrait mode by setting
the right page dimensions.  
[Here's an
example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k2Er26_MJhwrYEMcwiq766OCTMAFj4V2fqb9kP3tdn8/edit?usp=sharing).

Go go your Google Slides.  
Click File -> Page setup...

Select Custom, and enter an aspect ratio of 9:16 (Normal TV's aspect ratio)  
7.5 and 13.33 inches are a good reference.  
That's it! you can start editing your sides now and assign it to your screens
