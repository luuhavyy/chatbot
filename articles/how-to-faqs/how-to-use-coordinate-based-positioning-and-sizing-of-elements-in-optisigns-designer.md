# How to Use Coordinate-Based Positioning and Sizing of Elements in OptiSigns' Designer

If you want to craft visually appealing and professional designs, achieving
pixel-perfect layouts and precise element positioning is essential.

In this article, we'll guide you on using coordinates to accurately place and
size elements on your canvas.

# **Ready to get started? Then, let's jump in:**

  * Go to **Designer** App by going to your Files/Assets page â†’ Apps

  * Click on any text or image to access the menu options on the top.

Click on '**Position** ' on the top right hand corner

By clicking on the '**Position** ', this will display the **Position options**
on the right hand side of your canvas.

Under the **Advanced** section, you will see the following options:

  * **Left** \- Input a numeric value to specify the horizontal position of the selected element within your canvas. 
    * By entering a numerical value, you can specify a numerical value to determine how far the element is positioned from the left side of the canvas.
  * **Top** \- Input a numeric value to specify the vertical position of the selected element within your canvas. 
    * By entering a numerical value, you can specify a numerical value to determine how far the element is positioned from the top edge of the canvas.
  * **Width** \- This option lets you define the horizontal size, or width, of the selected element. 
    * You can input a numerical value to specify how wide the element should be.
  * **Height** \- This option allows you to set the vertical size of the selected element. 
    * By entering a numerical value, you determine how tall the element should be.
  * **Maintain Aspect Ratio link (for images or graphical elements only)** \- This feature is a convenient tool for maintaining the original proportions of the selected element while adjusting its width and height. 
    * When activated (with the link set to "Vertical," as shown above), changing one dimension (width or height) will automatically adjust the other dimension to preserve the aspect ratio.
    * This ensures that the element doesn't become distorted when resized.

## **That's all!**
