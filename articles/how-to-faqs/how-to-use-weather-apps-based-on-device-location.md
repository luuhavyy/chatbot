# How to Use Weather Apps Based on Device Location

If you have many screens in different locations, and you want to display local
weather, you can just make 1 weather app, and set it to use device's location
instead of having to make many weather apps.

First set your device's location.

In Edit screen, click Advanced, and add location.

You can also edit location of multiple screens at the same time by selecting
them and click Edit

Next, in your weather app select the option to "Use Device Setting's
Location".

You still need to set the default location, this location will be used in case
device does not have location set up.

#### For more information on weather apps, see our article on [how to use
weather apps in OptiSigns](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360017964153-How-to-Use-Weather-Apps-in-OptiSigns).

#### **That's all!**

Now you can use this Weather app in your playlist, schedule, etc. and when the
device plays, it will use the location's set in its settings to get Weather
information.
