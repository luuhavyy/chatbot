# Why Does My Screen Show as "Offline" on the Web Portal?

The OptiSigns Digital Signage application updates the web portal with your
screen's status every 30 seconds. If it has not heard from the application
after 10 minutes, it will be marked as offline.

This is usually caused by:

  * The OptiSigns app not being open on the device, even if the device is on
  * Network connectivity issues

Any changes made to the device on the portal while the device is offline will
be applied the next time it comes online.

If you'd like to make sure your OptiSigns app boots up when your device is
turned on, see [this article.](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-
us/articles/360025626853-How-to-start-OptiSigns-automatically-when-devices-
boot-up)

## That's all!
