Click YouTube Playlist app:

Enter your YouTube Playlist information:

  * _Name_ : Give your YouTube Playlist a name. This is for displaying in your asset list only. The app will try to get the video's title and use as a name, but you can change it to something else.
  * _URL_ : Paste the link to your YouTube playlist here.
  * _Caption:_ If the YouTube video has closed caption, the app will show it. Note: closed caption must be created by the YouTube video author, auto generated caption may not work.

want.
