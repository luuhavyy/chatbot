Take control of your files, assets, and folders by personalizing their
thumbnails. By adding your personal touch to thumbnails, you can enhance your
browsing experience, effortlessly spot and distinguish specific items, and
uphold a polished and cohesive visual identity.

## **Let's jump in and get started:**

#### **1) Go to Files/Assets page**

Click on the three dots in the upper right-hand corner of an asset or folder.

Select "Replace Thumbnail"

Upload the file that will replace the thumbnail. When done, click on "Upload".

**Important notes:**

  * File formats supported are GIF, PNG, JPG, WEBP, SVG, and MP4
  * Cannot exceed 500 KB
  * You can update thumbnails for files, assets, and folders i.e. apps, images, videos, etc.
