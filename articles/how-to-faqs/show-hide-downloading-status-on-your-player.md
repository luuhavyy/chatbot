# Show/Hide downloading status on your Player

With Android, Fire TV, Windows, Linux, and Raspberry Pi players, you can set
to show/hide downloads.

When the player is downloading video/images, it will show the download status
like this:

Download status help you to know that change is being applied and how fast is
your download speed.

Sometimes you want to disable this to have a smoother experience for your
viewers.

You can do so by going to the Advanced section of Edit Screen and uncheck
"Show Downloading Status".

If you have many screens, can select multiple and apply this settings to all
of them.

Or on the player, you can open Side Menu -> Advanced -> and uncheck Show
Downloading Status.

That's it!
