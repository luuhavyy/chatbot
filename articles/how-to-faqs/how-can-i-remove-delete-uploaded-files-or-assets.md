# How Can I Remove/Delete Uploaded Files or Assets?

  1. Hover the mouse on the asset in the **Files/Assets** tab.
  2. Click the vertical**... icon** on the asset/file you'd like to remove.
  3. Click **Delete.**

**Can I recover my deleted files? Does the app have a trash bin or recycle
bin?**

No. Once the file is deleted, it's completely deleted from our servers and
cannot be recovered. Please carefully consider your files and assets before
deleting them from your account.
