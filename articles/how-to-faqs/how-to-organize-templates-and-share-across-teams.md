# How to organize templates and share across teams 

When there is a large number of templates and a complex structure of
teams/departments, how to manage templates and share them with others could be
difficult. For example, there are hundreds of templates of different themes,
some should only be available to team A and some should be available to other
teams. How that should be managed with OptiSigns?

The recommended approach is to leverage the folder structure and folder
permissions to organize the templates and manage the authorization.

In general, it is mainly 3 parts.

  * Set up the proper folder/sub-folder structure to organize the templates, so it is easier to navigate.
  * Configure the permissions on the folder to have it assigned to the right teams. Since the template cannot be modified, the folder should be set up with "View" permission only. 
  * When others use the template, they will not have permission to save and change the template, instead, they will have to "save as" at another location where they have permission.

Here is an example. The "QR_Code_Template" is under TemplateFolder /
TemplateSubFolder. To make it only viewable but not modifiable by others, you
will need to set the folder permission to view only. In this case, the folder
is available to Team 1. So users from Team1 can open and use the template, but
they cannot modify the template and have to save it to another location where
they have permission.

Determine who should have permission can be managed through the folder
permission setting. Since this is used as a template, the permission should be
viewed only by others.

The template will be available to users from Team1.

The users will be able to open the template and make changes, however when
they try to save it, it will be declined because of permission. Users have to
use click "Save As" to save it to a location they have permission.

Users can save it to a location they have edit permission by choosing a folder
and clicking the "Save As" button.

### **That's all!**

This is how you can leverage the folder structures and permissions to manage
the templates and share them across teams.
