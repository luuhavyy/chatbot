# Assign content to your screens

Once you get screens added, you can start assigning, updating the content, or
scheduling the content it plays.  
The steps below are for you to assign a playlist, but you can follow the same
process to assign any assets or schedules. You can also schedule your content
to go live.

### 1) Assign content to your screen

To assign the playlist to your screen: Go to the **Screen** tab.

Click "**Edit** " button on the screen you want to change.

Click the Type drop-down list and select Playlist.

Click the Selected Playlist drop-down and select the playlist you've created.
In this case, we select "Lobby TV Playlist"

Click **Save**

That's all, the Screen will be updated.

### 2) Schedule your content to go-live

After you select your content, you can click the **Schedule** button.

Then you can set up the schedule to go-live  

  * **Schedule go-live time** : 
    * Set a time when you want the screens to start playing this content. The screen(s) will play this content from this time onward.
    * An Expiration feature will also be provided to stop the content that is temporarily assigned.

That's all, the Screen will be scheduled.
