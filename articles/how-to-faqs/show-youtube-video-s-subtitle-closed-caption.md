# Show YouTube video's subtitle/closed caption

You can show YouTube video's subtitles on your OptiSigns Digital Signage
player.

Simply check the Caption box of your YouTube asset in OptiSigns.  
NOTE: The YouTube video needs to have closed caption generated by the video
author. Auto-generated captions may not work (this is a YouTube limitation).
