# How to use Notice Board app

Notice Board app is a quick & simple way to create and put up a slide on your
screens. It's just like create a simple PowerPoint or Google Slides slide
inside OptiSigns.

Here's a quick look of the editor:

To use the Notice Board app, in Files/Assets you can simply click on Apps ->
Notice Board

Then select from a template or start with a blank one. We will be adding more
templates regularly.

If you select "Create New", you can accept the default 1920x1080 width &
height, or if your need to create portrait notice board, you can change to
1080x1920.

From here on, the Editor is pretty much similar to PowerPoint or Google
Slides, you can just click on objects to move it, edit text, adding pictures,
draw shape etc.

If you want to align an object horizontally, vertically or bring it front,
back. You can use this context menu.

Once you are done, you can give your Notice Board a name and Click Save.  
Please remember to click Save often to save your changes.

Now the asset is created in your library, and you can use it just like any
other images assets, and can assign it to your screens, playlists or schedules
to use it.
