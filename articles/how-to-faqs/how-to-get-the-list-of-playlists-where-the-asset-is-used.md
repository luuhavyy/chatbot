# How to get the list of playlists where the asset is used 

When there are a lot of assets and playlists to manage, especially the assets
are included in many playlists and you need to replace the asset, it may be
difficult to find all the playlists and get the asset replaced. Knowing in
which playlist the asset is used is very helpful in this situation. And this
is possible with OptiSigns.

**To get the list of playlists where the asset is used.**

1) Click the button on the top right of the asset to open up the context menu.

2) Select the "Show playlist using this" from the context menu. Then a popup
will be showing up with all the playlists where the asset is used.

You can see all the playlists in the popup window, and the playlist name is
clickable, it will redirect you to the playlist editor of the chosen playlist.
You can manage the playlist content there.

### **That's all!**

This is how you can get the list of playlists where the asset is used.
