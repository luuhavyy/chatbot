# How to use HDMI & other video input sources in with OptiSigns

It can be useful to split up your screens with part of Live TV, HDMI in, and
part display of other information.

You will need a USBvideo capture device plugged into your Windows PC, and
connect your TV set-top box HDMI cable to the USB capture device.

Make sure you are running the latest version of OptiSigns Player on that box
(the minimum required version is 4.2.15)  
We recommend our [OptiSigns Pro
Player](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-digital-signage-player)
or a minimum PC with Intel i5 CPU running Windows or better.

### **Let's jump in and get started:**

Then go to <https://app.optisigns.com/>

Click Files/Assets -> Apps

Then find the Live TV app:  

Give it a name & click Save

Then you can put this TV app in a Playlist or a Zone of your
[SplitScreen](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026559573).

### **That's all! Congratulation!**

When you assign the SplitScreen to your WIndows Mini PC it will play the video
input and other splitscreen content.

Troubleshooting common problems:

1) Make sure your USB device is working and showing content in other apps like
[OBS Streaming](https://obsproject.com).

2) Troubleshoot, change video, audio sources by go to OptiSigns Player's side
menu select Live TV input sources.

And select the correct input source.
