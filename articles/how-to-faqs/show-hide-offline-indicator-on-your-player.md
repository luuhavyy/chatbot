# Show/Hide Offline Indicator on your Player

By default, if the device is offline, OptiSigns Player will keep playing
cached content and skip some content that requires online (i.e. YouTube), if
you have critical content requiring network like Dashboards, you can turn
offline indicator to let the viewer know that the device is offline.

Here's how the offline indicator would look.

There is about 1-minute delay before the offline indicator is shown, this is
to prevent intermittent, momentary network issues.

To enable Show Offline Indicator, go to Edit Screen -> Advanced and check
"Show Offline Indicator".

You can select multiple screens and turn this on at the same time too.

You can also go to the device's Side Menu -> Advanced -> Show Offline
Indicator and turn it on.
