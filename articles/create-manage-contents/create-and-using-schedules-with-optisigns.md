## Scheduling Around Time Zones

  * Device 1 is in the EST time zone (GMT - 5).
  * Device 2 is in the PST time zone (GMT - 8).

You set a schedule item to play from 10 AM to 11 AM on 1/1/20XX.

  * Device 1 will play the schedule item from 10 AM to 11 AM on 1/1/20XX in its local time (EST).
  * Device 2 will play the schedule item from 10 AM to 11 AM on 1/1/20XX in its local time (PST).

Daylight saving time adjustments will be handled automatically.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Schedules

**What if there is a one-time schedule overlapping a recurring schedule?**

The one-time schedule will take priority.

**Example:**

  * Recurring schedule A (9 AM - 5 PM daily) overlaps with a one-time schedule B (10 AM - 11 AM) today.

**Playback Order:**

  * 9 AM - 10 AM: Recurring schedule A
  * 10 AM - 11 AM: Single schedule B
  * 11 AM - 5 PM: Recurring schedule A resumes

**What if there are two recurring schedules overlapping?**

The most recently created/ updated schedule will take priority.

**What happens when there's nothing scheduled?**

If there is no scheduled content, the screen will display a black screen by
default. To avoid this, you can set default content. There are two ways to do
this:

  * **At the Schedule Level:** Edit the specific schedule, click on **Settings** , and select your preferred default content (None, Account Default, Asset, or Playlist).

  * **At the Account Level:** Apply a default content setting that will apply to all newly created schedules. The schedule-level setting will take priority if both are set.

Schedules](https://support.optisigns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040943374)

**Can I move an existing schedule to a folder I created?**  
Yes, you can click on **Move Schedule** on the top of the Schedule menu and
then select the folder you wish to move the schedule to.

**Is it possible to manage schedules for multiple locations from a single
interface?** Yes, users can manage schedules for multiple locations from a
central interface. This is particularly useful for organizations with screens
in different geographical areas.
