# Assign Default Content for Schedules

If you create a schedule, at times when there's no content scheduled, the
display will default to a black screen.  
For example the schedule below, at 7AM the screen will just display a black
screen.  
Sometime, you would want to set a default content so that when nothing is
scheduled the default content will be displayed.

There are 2 ways you can setup defaults content:

1\. At the schedule level (apply to a schedule only). To do so, click on the
Schedule you want to edit, then click Option.

Then select if you want to use:

  * **None:** just a black screen when nothing is scheduled
  * **Use Account Default:** using what set at account level (see #2 below for how).
  * **Asset:** select and asset to be displayed when nothing is scheduled
  * **Playlist:** select a playlist to be played when nothing is scheduled 

2\. Or at Account level so it will apply to all **newly created schedule.**
(In case you both at account level and at schedule level, the schedule level
setting will take priority for that schedule).

Then select if you want to use:

  * **None:** just a black screen when nothing is scheduled
  * **Asset:** select and asset to be displayed when nothing is scheduled
  * **Playlist:** select a playlist to be played when nothing is scheduled 

### Summary:

Sometime, you would want to set a default content so that when nothing is
scheduled the default content will be displayed. There are 2 ways to set
default content, one is at each schedule level, and one is at whole account
level and will be applied to all newly created schedule.
