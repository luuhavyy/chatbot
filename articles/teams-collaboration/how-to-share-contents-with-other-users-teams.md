# How to Share Contents with Other Users/Teams

#### Teams are designed for the separation of resources to maintain structured
and secure workflows. Despite the separation, cross-teaming resource sharing
is supported using folder security features. With OptiSigns, you can use
folder security features in the folder and share the folder with different
teams.

**Note:** This feature is only available in the Pro Plan or above.  
---  
  
**Use Case:** You want to share global or specific regional folders with
users/teams. Set up the permission in the folder. A Shared Folder gives
OptiSigns Account Admins/Owners the ability to share content with different
users/teams. Shared Folder works on any feature in OptiSigns, including
Screens, Files/Assets, Playlists, or Schedule Tabs.

Best Practices

**Central Management:** Create screens in each team and share them back to the
default team for centralized management.  
**Corporate-Wide Content:** Develop corporate-wide content in the default team
and share it with other teams for broader distribution.
